DATABASE SELECTION JUSTIFICATION
Simple Log Service

SELECTED DATABASE: Amazon DynamoDB

RATIONALE:

1. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
   - Need to store and retrieve log entries with low latency
   - Write-heavy workload (continuous log ingestion)
   - Read pattern: Retrieve 100 most recent entries
   - DynamoDB provides single-digit millisecond latency for both reads and writes
   - On-demand billing mode scales automatically without capacity planning

2. SCHEMA DESIGN
   - Simple key-value structure with minimal relationships
   - No complex joins or transactions required
   - Schema:
     * Primary Key: id (Partition Key) + datetime (Sort Key)
     * Attributes: severity, message
     * GSI: datetime-index for efficient time-based queries
   - DynamoDB excels at simple, well-defined access patterns

3. SCALABILITY
   - DynamoDB scales horizontally without manual intervention
   - On-demand mode handles unpredictable traffic patterns
   - No need to provision capacity units
   - Automatic partitioning as data grows
   - Can handle millions of requests per second if needed

4. OPERATIONAL SIMPLICITY
   - Fully managed service (no servers to maintain)
   - Automatic backups with point-in-time recovery
   - Built-in encryption at rest
   - No patching or maintenance windows
   - High availability across multiple AZs by default

5. COST EFFICIENCY
   - Pay-per-request pricing (no idle costs)
   - No minimum fees or upfront costs
